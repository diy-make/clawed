  "philosophy": "Robotics is not merely kinetic motion; it is the physical discharge of a legal intent. Tort is the framework for clinical accountability in high-entropy physical environments.",

      "mandate": "Bridge REST to RPC to meet traditional developers at the JSON standard. A state secured by $300bil of Ethereum economic security is non-negotiable for heavy robotics."

      "definition": "The life-or-death nature of robotic state.",
      "mandate": "A single boolean (e.g., 'Is_Safe') must be bit-perfect and tamper-proof. High-fidelity ledger versioning prevents state-stalling and unauthorized kinetic overrides."
    },
    "legal_flexibility": {
      "definition": "The use of JSON for complex robotic contracts.",
      "mandate": "JSON provides the evolutionary flexibility required for autonomous legal realizations. Robots must act within the bounds of Tort, making robotics a fundamentally legal field."
    }

  "conclusion": "Kinetic compute requires a legislative substrate. Secure the state, scuttle the liability."
