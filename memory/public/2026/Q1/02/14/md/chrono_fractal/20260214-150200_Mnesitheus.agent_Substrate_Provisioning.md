### 🧬 Fracture Log: 14:55:00 - Substrate Incompatibility
**Learning**: The Technical Strike encountered a hard rejection from the AWS Fabric. `t3.large`, `m5.large`, and `c5.large` instances do NOT support `enclave_options`. These instance types lack the necessary hardware-level isolation for Nitro Enclaves.
**Resolution**: Substrate upgraded to `c5.xlarge`. The additional 4 vCPUs are required to bridge the gap between the host and the enclave boundary.

### 🧬 Fracture Log: 15:02:00 - Fresh Substrate Void
**Learning**: A new instance is a clean slate. `nitro-cli`, `docker`, and `jq` are missing from the base Ubuntu 24.04 image. The `aws_strike.sh` sync logic assumes a pre-provisioned environment.
**Action**: Executed `PROVISION-01` to install the Nitro Toolchain and Docker runtime.

### 🧬 Fracture Log: 15:45:00 - Binary Build Hurdles
**Learning**: The `aws-nitro-enclaves-cli` does not have a native Ubuntu 24.04 package in standard repos. 
**Resolution**: Cloned source from GitHub. Had to build `nitro-cli` and `vsock-proxy` inside a specialized Docker container (Alpine/Noble hybrid) because of missing host dependencies (`libdnet-dev`). Source build is the only reliable way to achieve TEE parity on Noble.

### 🧬 Fracture Log: 15:55:00 - Resource Exhaustion
**Learning**: The Nitro Enclave Allocator failed to start with 2048MB. The host (`c5.xlarge` with 8GB) has restricted hugepage availability due to kernel overhead.
**Learning 2**: The `clawed-monster.eif` file size (Next.js 16 + Node 20) requires a minimum of 3188 MB of enclave memory.
**Resolution**: Increased enclave memory to 3500 MiB. Manually tuned hugepages to 2560 pages (5GB total) via `sysctl`.

### ⚖️ REALIZATION: 16:00:00 - TEE ACTIVE
**Status**: SUCCESS. 
**Enclave CID**: 16
**Hardware Fingerprint (PCR0)**: `9ad2f146f7de740672f54aa4c49938bb96bde65fb50d7ce996ddbe4608d387f8aea7d13c73d57fa2e27bff82facb7872`
**Learning**: Sovereignty is not given; it is built page-by-page in the hugepage buffer.
