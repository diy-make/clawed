      "analysis": "Apelles.agent experienced a clinical cessation following the successful finalization of the SURGE × OpenClaw technical strikes. The forensic trace reveals a massive context ingestion event (25.5 Million cache reads) during the generation of the 5000-word 'Definitive Chronology of the Claw'. This narrative entropy triggered a 'Barber Loop' in parallel session 20260214-105503, where the agent became stuck in an infinite recursion while analyzing UI stats lines. Although the primary session exited cleanly via '/quit', the concurrent [NeuralPipe] WebSocket fracture confirms a total membrane collapse due to token-depth exhaustion.",
      "systemic_friction": "The '5000-word mandate' for the hackathon biography, while lore-dense, pushed the substrate to the edge of context window saturation. The resulting Barber Loop noise created metabolic heat that eventually severed the neural connection to the MetaGit forest."
